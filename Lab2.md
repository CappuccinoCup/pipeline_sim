# Architecture Labs: Pipeline Simulator â€“ Lab2

### 0. Background

Sometimes we need to take an in-depth look at how an instruction is executed and how it affects the CPU states. Given that **pipeline** is widely used in modern CPUs, in this project, you are expected to build an easy pipeline simulator using **ARM** instructions as input.

### 1. Goal

In this project, you will finish a pipeline simulator using C++. Instructions are read from a file along with their latency. The simulator should visualize the execution of these instructions and outputs the change of CPU states, as well as the CPI for this instruction sequence. Then, using QRIO, you need to randomly pick a sequence of no less than 10 instructions, and simulate these instructions with your completed pipeline simulator.

### 2. Compile and Run

Open the terminal, cd to the "pipeline_sim" directory, and execute the following commands:

```bash
# Compile pipeline_sim
g++ -std=c++11 ./src/pipeline_sim.cpp ./src/parser.cpp -o pipeline_sim

# The input instructions file is preset to "./instruction.txt"
# The input latency file is preset to "./latency.txt"
./pipeline_sim
```

***Note***: when you run it for the first time, you will find that the simulator simply fills the instruction sequence into the pipeline in order, and the register state will not change in any way. It's your work to complete the pipeline simulator and make it run correctly.

The simulation result will be dumped into "result.txt". It shows which instructions are executed at each stage of the pipeline for each clock cycle, as well as the value of each register at the end of this cycle. For example: 

```bash
# "instruction.txt" is the same content as "testcases/EZCall.txt"

# ...

# In this cycle, pipeline is executing as following

======= WB =======			# Write back the result of a "mov" instr (pc: 0x04)
mov
======= MEM ======			# Access memory for a "mov" instr (pc: 0x08)
mov
======= EX =======			# Execute for a "cmp & bge" instr (pc: 0x0c)
cmp & bge
======= ID =======			# Decode a instr (turn out to be a "bl" instr, pc: 0x10)
bl
======= IF =======			# Fetch a instr (turn out to be a "b" instr, pc: 0x14)
b

# After the above execution, register state is:

reg[0]    = 1         	reg[1]    = 2         	reg[2]    = 0         	reg[3]    = 0         	
reg[4]    = 0         	reg[5]    = 0         	reg[6]    = 0         	reg[7]    = 0         	
reg[8]    = 0         	reg[9]    = 0         	reg[10]   = 0         	reg[11]   = 0         	
reg[12]   = 0         	reg[13]   = 3000      	reg[14]   = 0x0       	reg[15]   = 0x18      	

# Instruction executed so far:
Instr N: 2
# Latency (clock cycle) so far:
Latency: 7

# ...

# CPI = Latency / Instr N
CPI: 3.2
```

***Note***: we provide a sample program "pipeline_sim_ref" for reference. We also give 5 sample instruction sequences in "testcases". You can replace the contents of "instruction.txt" with any of these test cases, and then run the sample program. Observe the test case and the corresponding "result_ref.txt" and you can get more understanding.

### 3. Pipeline Model

The classic pipeline is divided into five stages.

#### IF (Instruction Fetch)

In this stage, you need to fetch the next instruction according to PC. In this project, a **Parser** will read instruction sequences and wrap them into a vector. All you need to do is to get the correct instruction, and then increase PC.

#### ID (Instruction Decode)

For readability, we use the string form of instruction instead of the binary form in "instruction.txt". Thus, in this stage, you needn't actually decode the instruction. All you need to do is to collect the instruction information passed by the **IF** stage.

However, to deal with **data hazards**, you need to support **forwarding**. There are two types of **forwarding**: one is to fetch operand from **EX** stage and the other is from **MEM** stage. (***Note***: to deal with **load-use data hazards**, just forwarding is not enough. Maybe you should do more operations.)

#### EX (Execute)

In this stage, you need to execute according to the operation types and operands given in the **ID** stage. For arithmetic instructions, you need to calculate the result. For memory access instructions, you need to calculate the memory access address. For branch instructions, you need to calculate the target address.

#### MEM (Memory)

In this stage, you should access memory if needed. Also, you need to detect **control hazards** in this stage according to **zero** flag (set in **EX** stage by cmp instructions) and **branch** signal (for simplicity, you only need to check if the **opcode** is a branch instruction).

#### WB (Write Back)

In this stage, you should write calculation results back to registers if needed.

After these five pipeline stages, there remain some hazards (**load-use data hazards** and **control hazards**) to be dealt with (normal **data hazards** have been dealt with in **ID** stage using **forwarding**). Thus, you need to perform some additional operations, such as inserting bubbles, changing the value of PC, etc.

***Note***: there is no branch predictor in this pipeline model. In other words, when encountering branch instructions, you should always treat it as **not taken**, even for branch instructions such as **b** and **bl** (to avoid some unnecessary troubles).

### 4. Assumptions

1. There are 16 32-bit registers: general purpose registers (r0 - r13), stack pointer (sp), link register (lr), and program counter (pc).
2. Total memory space is 6000 bytes. Top address [5001, 6000] is preserved. Stack decreases from 5000, while heap increases from 0.
3. PC starts from 0x0. Memory allocation is defined using ".space" followed by the allocated size (bytes). 
4. Compare (cmp) and the following Branch (bge or bne) are considered to be one instruction, like "cmp reg1, reg2 bge label".
5. Input instruction sequence is taken from "instruction.txt" while latency is taken from "latency.txt".

### 5. TODO

In lab2, your work can be divided into several steps:

1. Familiar with the project code. Run the reference program and observe the input and output.
2. Fix and complete each pipeline stage.
3. Deal with pipeline hazards.
4. Compare the simulation result of your implementation and the reference program.

    - Directory "testcases" gives some example programs for testing, and "pipeline_sim_ref" gives the sample program as a reference. 
    - ***Your implementation should behave the same as the sample program***.

5. (Optional) Co-operating with QRIO

    - Using QRIO to run an arbitrary program and get the instruction trace. (Just run qemu and rio using the same method in Lab1). Randomly pick a sequence of no less than 10 instructions (in binary form). (***Note***: please skip unsupported instructions)
    - Decode the sequence (to string form) by yourself. Here is a handy [online assembler and disassembler](https://shell-storm.org/online/Online-Assembler-and-Disassembler/) can help you to finish this job.
    - Using your pipeline simulator to simulate it.
